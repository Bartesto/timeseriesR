The work contained here forms the basis of time series analysis tools developed for the Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis section. **Unless stated otherwise** in the header notes of the various function scripts, the starting data set must be a data frame created from using the **mtsd.r** script. The running of this script ensures that the data frame is in the correct format, namely:

1. that the data has been summarised to mthly averages
2. that missing values have been interpolated to create a regular time series
3. there is a "date" column
4. that all unique site values are in separate columns

These functions, tools and scripts are the tested and documented versions for distribution to the group. Trial versions and workings are contained in the time_series_dev repository linked to the time_series_dev folder located at Z:\DOCUMENTATION\BART\R\R_DEV.
